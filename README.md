Spring standalone application AOP example

In this example I created a simple standalone Spring application with AOP.
A few things you can see in this demo:

1. Only spring beans are intercepted.
2. Only calls between different beans are intercepted. Method calls within the same bean are not intercepted by Spring AOP.
3. Different AOP advices.
